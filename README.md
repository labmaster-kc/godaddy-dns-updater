### Credit
* This is a fork of parker-hemphill/godaddy-dns-updater
* Simple edit to add GoDaddy API Secret, seems to be required now.
* Also an opportunity for me to start with Github and Docker Hub
### Flow of operations:
* 1: Container starts up and sleeps number of seconds specified by **DNS_CHECK** (Defaults to 900 seconds, or 15 minutes if variable not provided)
* 2: Once **DNS_CHECK** time has passed, container waits between 1 and 15 seconds (Randomized each time the loop runs so that you can run multiple containers and not cause an API time-out)
  * Curl makes a call to **https://api.ipify.org** to determine current external IP address of host.
  * Curl then makes a call to GoDaddy DNS API to get current record for sub-domain/domain, if that IP address doesn't match external IP there is a curl POST pushed to update the DNS record
* 3: Container start-up and any changes to DNS record are logged inside container to **/tmp/<DOMAIN_NAME>-log**, this directory can be exported to make the logs available outside container
  
### Notes:
* Required variables have a default set of NULL, the container looks for these and exits with a message of problem in the log file.  An easy way to trouble-shoot container is to map /tmp to an external directory (explained in the docker-compose and docker run example below)
* Only required ENV variables are **DOMAIN** and **API_KEY**, everything else has valid defaults
   * Labmaster 2020.11.05 - Added required ENV variable **API_SECRET**
* ENV variables "PUID" and "PGID" can be passed to set owner of logfile to a specific user, this is useful for mapping an external directory and setting the owner to a normal user
## Docker-compose example
* In this example I will be monitoring and updating **cool-site.example.com**, and checking for a change to DNS every 600 seconds (10 minutes)
  * **volumes** can be omitted or mapped somewhere such as a a folder under your home directory, simply change the *left* side to point to where you'd like to save DNS update logfiles
* Change "TIME_ZONE" to match your desired timezone.  A vaild list can be found at https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_tz_database_time_zones under the "TZ database name" column.  Default is "America/New_York"
